# analysis-of-machine-learning-algorithm-for-gender-classification
We have various machine algorithms for gender classification but choosing best one is important task.  For selecting best algorithm we conducted experimental study on machine learning algorithms for gender classification. In this experimental study of machine learning algorithms, we analyzed performance of various algorithms for gender classification using voice dataset.  From this study we concluded that SVM and ANN are giving best results.
Both the SVM and ANN are giving better results compared with other machine learning algorithms.
 SVM is giving 97% accuracy on both train, test sets with linear kernel. Artificial Neural Network with three hidden dense layer of each contains 1000 nodes and relu as activation function, one input layer with 20 features and one output layer consists two nodes. 
In the output layer softmax is used as activation function and adam optimizer used then ANN is giving 98% accuracy
